# Some STM32 Noodling #

Project to illustrate some (mis)use of ST's HAL, and where workarounds are necessary.

The board I'm using is a "Baite" clone of the Maple Mini, running the updated Maple bootloader.

We'll be using encoder input mode, generating stepper motor signalling, but doing as little actual work as possible.
